# homeWork2
Homework 2 is a first version (early edition) of Joseph Chaudhari’s next venture: The Proponti Group.
The Proponti Group is a business consulting group that focuses an applying innovative frameworks and unconventional solutions to help its client survive and thrive during the COVID-19 depressed economy. This website features a basic homepage, about page, contact page, and portfolio page. The Portfolio of Proponti has yet to be filled out since Proponti’s first client – TeliTire – is still in its infancy phase. 
HTML and CSS were used to develop this website. Online images and references were used to help support the creation and refinement of this website. I ran into problems implementing the grid system as we discussed in week 3.
